# Taiwanese Food-101 Classification

This repository presents a deep learning project for recognizing **traditional Taiwanese dishes** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** built with **PyTorch**.  
A **ResNet-18** model (pretrained on ImageNet) is fine-tuned on the **TW Food-101 dataset**, which contains **over 20,000 images** across **101 iconic Taiwanese food categories** such as *beef noodles*, *bubble tea*, *bawan*, and more.

The goal of this project is to develop an efficient and accurate food image classifier that can serve as a foundation for applications in **smart restaurant menus**, **AI-assisted food recognition**, or **cultural food datasets**.
